# Chip-8 Emulator
A simple Chip-8 emulator written in C++. It uses SDL3 to manage the window and the inputs.
To execute it, you must open it through the command line with the ROM you want to launch, like the following:

    Chip-8 Tetris.ch8  

In the /Roms directory there are all the ROMs I tested, they should work fine.
